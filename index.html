        <div class="description">
            <p>How often do we do considerable amounts of work before receiving any feedback ? This usually leads to revising extensive effort.</p>
            <p>We avoid this trap by sharing thoughts, ideas and recipes (yes, we love food from the world) on a weekly basis; we organise workshops, networking events and often go on retreats together.</p>
            <p>As a partner of Opportunus, you interact with other members on a weekly basis, let in being online or “in real life”. These discussions can range from the critical marketing strategy of your start-up to your shared eclectic taste of music (we encourage productive topics though). This enables healthy competitivity, social accountability and allows to get early feedback on any piece of work. We see this as an extension of our lifestyles.</p>

        <div class="description">
            <p>Meeting, discussing with and recruiting like minded individuals who share our values are key to our growth. It enables  thrilling discussions where ideas and projects flourish.</p>
            <p>Networking is free, most of the time. Networking events are full of like-minded individuals, and if you go to the right events, they are full of people that you can work with or learn from in some way. They are probably the most valuable uses of your time, when you’re not with your family. We bring these people in our club.</p>

            <p>We want to influence not only within our club community, but in the wider community and society too.</p>
            <p>The club organises but invites guests to present or give back. Our lifestyle involves enabling the community around us to grow with us. We encourage pro-bono actions that redistribute skills and knowledge to the public.</p>
